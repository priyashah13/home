# Write it down

Writing makes companies better.

The nature of work today is transient. People discuss, debate, and decide over meetings and slack. But these conversations deteriorate - they lose detail and clarity over time.

Writing avoids this. When you document discussions and decisions, they become immune to memory loss, absent team members, or confused recollections.

Especially complex work like technical architectures and product strategy need clear documentation. The details matter too much to trust to memory.

Writing also forces clear thinking. You can't hide behind vague ideas when you have to write them down. Youâ€™re forced to organize and add structure. Better yet, written ideas are more open to critique, correction, and collaboration, making them stronger over time.

Writing is worth the time. The fuzzy becomes clear, the temporary becomes permanent. Linear tickets, Notion docs, or FigJam boards - just write it down. You won't regret it.
