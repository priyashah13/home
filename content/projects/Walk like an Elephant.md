# Walk Like an Elephant

**Pen on paper**  
**55cm x 45cm**

Inspired by a story that my grandad would tell me, the piece is about being confident and holding your own despite what other people might say; to walk like an elephant. The elephant is both strong and elegant. While the sheer size of it shows its strength and power, I wanted to emphasize on its elegance by using an art form closely associated with femininity in India - Mehendi. The elephant is also often associated with Lord Ganesha, God of wisdom, knowledge and new beginnings. | used black and white to get high contrast and highlights of pink to add subtle color.
