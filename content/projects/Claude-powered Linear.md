# Claude-powered Linear

Collaborating across multiple teams is hard. A single source of truth helps, and for many software companies, that source is [Linear](https://linear.app/). I personally spend a lot of my time in Linear and try to bring non-engineering teams on board as well. But keeping a source of truth up-to-date takes real work.  
  
So at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)'s hackathon, we used their new Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect Claude's capabilities with our favorite productivity tool: Linear. Our goal was to make it easier than ever to maintain and leverage one of your company's most important databases.  
  
Three hour hackathons might be my new favorite format.
